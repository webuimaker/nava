To solve a problem, it helps to find its cause. At Fertility Centers of Illinois, our process of careful evaluation paired with the use of the most advanced technologies allows us to pinpoint the cause of infertility in 95 percent of the patients we treat.
Below, we outline some of the many diagnostic procedures that we use. Each provides valuable insights, allowing us to pinpoint or eliminate many common causes of infertility.
Transvaginal Ultrasound
This procedure allows for an initial evaluation of the vagina, cervix, uterus, and ovaries and can be used in the diagnoses of menstrual problems, fibroids, abnormal bleeding, and other conditions.
Bloodwork
This informal term can be used to refer to any testing done of the blood. At Fertility Centers of Illinois, we frequently test the levels of certain hormones in the blood (FSH, LH, AMH, and estradiol) to help us determine the ovarian reserve â€” an important factor needed to design a treatment plan.
Hysterosalpingogram (HSG)
This is an X-ray that can uncover structural problems within the uterine cavity and the fallopian tubes. During the test, a small amount of liquid dye is inserted into the uterus so that any structural abnormalities of the uterine cavity and fallopian tubes can be identified.
Saline Infusion Sonohysterogram (SIS)
Saline infusion sonohysterogram (SIS or SHG) is a procedure using ultrasound guidance.  Specifically, sterile saline is injected to evaluate the uterine cavity and fallopian tubes. The purpose is to detect any abnormalities.
Semen Analysis
Infertility in men is assessed by performing a semen analysis. Through a semen analysis, our physicians can identify problems with semen volume and sperm concentration, motility, and morphology (shape). Any abnormalities of these parameters may contribute to infertility.
